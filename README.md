# CS182 EC Website

This project is a web application designed to display data scraped from EdStem. It consists of a Python-based scraper and a simple HTML/CSS/JS client.

## Project Structure

- **`client/`**: Contains the frontend code.
  - `index.html`: The main entry point for the website.
  - `style.css`: Styles for the website.
  - `script.js`: Logic to fetch and display the scraped data.
  - `data.json`: The data generated by the scraper (this file is created after running the scraper).
- **`scraper/`**: Contains the backend scraping logic.
  - `edpy/`: The `edpy` library used for interacting with the EdStem API.
  - `scrape.py`: The main script to fetch data.
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Scraper Setup

Before running the website with real data, you need to scrape it.

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  **Navigate to the scraper directory**:
    ```bash
    cd scraper
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure API Token**:
    - Create a file named `.env` in the `scraper/` directory.
    - Add your EdStem API token to it:
      ```
      ED_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
      ```
      *(Note: Do not commit `.env` to version control).*

5.  **Run the Scraper**:
    ```bash
    python scrape.py
    ```
    - This will fetch the data and save it to `../client/data.json`.

### 2. Client Setup

1.  **Open the Website**:
    - Simply open `client/index.html` in your web browser.
    - Alternatively, you can use a live server extension or `python -m http.server` in the `client` directory to serve it locally.

## Development

- **Formatting**: Please ensure code is formatted cleanly.
- **Scraping**: The `scrape.py` script is currently set up to fetch basic info. You can modify it to fetch more specific data endpoints available in `edpy`.
